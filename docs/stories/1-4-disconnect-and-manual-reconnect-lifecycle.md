# Story 1.4: Disconnect and Manual Reconnect Lifecycle

**Status:** review

## Story

As a developer,
I want explicit disconnect and reconnect controls,
So that I can recover from reloads or drops without restarting VS Code.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC 1: Clean Disconnect Transition

**Given** an active session
**When** I run Disconnect
**Then** the session closes cleanly
**And** state becomes disconnected.

### AC 2: Manual Reconnect Recovers Using Current Configuration

**Given** a disconnected, error, or connected (possibly stale) session
**When** I run Reconnect
**Then** the extension tears down any existing session first, then attempts recovery using current configuration
**And** reports success or failure within 5 seconds when the target browser and page are available (NFR2/NFR4).

### AC 3: Reconnect Failure Diagnostics Are Explicit and Actionable

**Given** reconnect fails
**When** diagnostics are rendered
**Then** the root-cause category is explicit
**And** the next recovery step is clear.

## Tasks / Subtasks

### 1. Add Lifecycle Commands and Wiring (AC: 1, 2)

- [x] Contribute command entries for disconnect and reconnect in package metadata.
  - [x] Add command ids: jupyterBrowserKernel.disconnect and jupyterBrowserKernel.reconnect in package.json contributes.commands.
  - [x] Add localization keys in package.nls.json and l10n/bundle.l10n.json for new command titles and any new runtime strings.
  - [x] Note: l10n/bundle.l10n.json is currently missing many Story 1.3 runtime strings (e.g., status labels, connect messages). Add new strings for this story; backfilling 1.3 gaps is out of scope but do not remove existing entries.
  - [x] Register both commands in src/extension.ts using existing runtime ownership patterns.
- [x] Activation events: no explicit activationEvents field is needed. VS Code auto-generates onCommand activation for all contributed commands. Adding disconnect/reconnect commands implicitly broadens activation, which is acceptable since those commands no-op safely without an active session.

### 2. Implement Transport-Owned Disconnect Behavior (AC: 1)

- [x] Add a disconnect command runtime that closes any active browser client/session idempotently.
  - [x] Reuse disconnectActiveBrowserConnection from src/transport/browser-connect.ts.
  - [x] Ensure repeated disconnect calls remain safe (already disconnected should not throw).
- [x] Drive canonical state transition to disconnected after disconnect completes.
  - [x] Keep state labels limited to disconnected/connecting/connected/error.
  - [x] Avoid introducing ad-hoc lifecycle booleans in command handlers.
- [x] Concurrency guard: if state is `connecting` (in-flight connect/reconnect), cancel the in-flight operation (tear down), then proceed with disconnect.
  - [x] From any state (connected, error, disconnected, connecting), disconnect must be safe and end in `disconnected`.
- [x] Note: `deactivate()` in extension.ts already calls `disconnectActiveBrowserConnection()` directly without updating the state store. This is correct — the extension is shutting down and state updates are unnecessary. Do not "fix" deactivate to also update state.

### 3. Implement Manual Reconnect Orchestration (AC: 2, 3)

- [x] Implement reconnect command flow that performs deterministic sequence:
  - [x] Read and validate endpoint using existing endpoint-config helpers.
  - [x] Tear down any existing active connection (force-reconnect from any state including connected).
  - [x] Note: connectViaBrowserTargetAttach internally calls clearActiveBrowserConnection() before setting new connection. Explicit pre-cleanup is still correct for state-management clarity; the transport's internal cleanup makes this idempotent, not redundant.
  - [x] Re-run connect operation via connectToBrowserTarget using current effective configuration.
  - [x] Update state to connecting and then connected/error via shared transition helper patterns.
- [x] Concurrency guard: if state is `connecting` (in-flight connect/reconnect), cancel the in-flight operation (tear down current transport), then proceed with fresh reconnect.
- [x] On success, show a distinct reconnect-specific message (e.g., "Jupyter Browser Kernel: Reconnected to target {0} at {1}.") to help users distinguish reconnect from initial connect.
- [x] Keep reconnect manual-only.
  - [x] Do not add timers, auto-retry loops, or background auto-reconnect behavior.
  - [x] Reconnect must report outcome within 5 seconds when the target is available (NFR2). Do not add long uncontrolled waits.

### 4. Failure Categorization and Recovery Guidance (AC: 3)

- [x] Reuse normalized connect failure categories in reconnect output.
  - [x] At minimum: target-mismatch, endpoint-connectivity, transport-failure.
- [x] Ensure reconnect failure diagnostics are state-led and actionable.
  - [x] Route settings prompt to cdpPort for endpoint-connectivity, otherwise cdpHost.
  - [x] Keep sensitive endpoint details redacted in user-facing messages.
  - [x] Include one concrete next step per failure branch.

### 5. UI State and Coexistence Guarantees (AC: 1, 2)

- [x] Keep one authoritative status indicator surface as the source of truth.
  - [x] Disconnect sets Disconnected immediately after successful cleanup.
  - [x] Reconnect sets Connecting during attempt and final Connected or Error.
- [x] Preserve browser-level CDP attach model for coexistence.
  - [x] Do not regress to page-level websocket attach.
  - [x] Keep flat session attach usage via Target.attachToTarget with flatten: true in connect path.

### 6. Tests and Regression Coverage (AC: 1, 2, 3)

- [x] Add unit tests for disconnect behavior.
  - [x] Active session disconnect closes client and transitions to disconnected.
  - [x] No active session disconnect is idempotent and remains non-fatal.
- [x] Add unit tests for reconnect command behavior.
  - [x] Happy path: disconnected/error to connecting to connected.
  - [x] Failure path: disconnected/error to connecting to error with categorized output.
  - [x] Validation failure path blocks reconnect attempt with field-specific corrective guidance.
  - [x] Force-reconnect path: connected to (teardown) to connecting to connected.
  - [x] Concurrency: reconnect while connecting cancels in-flight, proceeds with new attempt.
- [x] Add unit tests for disconnect concurrency.
  - [x] Disconnect while connecting cancels in-flight and transitions to disconnected.
- [x] Add unit tests for command registration/runtime wiring where needed.
  - [x] New commands are registered and call correct runtime handlers.
  - [x] Localization keys resolve for command labels/messages.
- [x] Keep tests in top-level tests folders only.

## Dev Notes

### Story Context and Scope

- Story 1.3 established browser-level connect, target attach, normalized connect failures, and canonical connection states.
- Story 1.4 extends lifecycle control with explicit disconnect and manual reconnect commands.
- This story is lifecycle control only. It does not introduce notebook execution semantics, profile-specific eligibility expansions, or auto-reconnect.

### Architecture Guardrails (Must Follow)

- Transport owns connection lifecycle and cleanup. Commands orchestrate flows but must not duplicate transport internals.
- Manual reconnect only; auto-reconnect is deferred.
- Normalized diagnostic categories only; no raw protocol errors to user surfaces.
- Preserve browser-level websocket + flat target session attachment for DevTools coexistence.
- See Story 1.3 for inherited guardrails: profile-owned target selection, endpoint redaction, activation scope, JavaScript-only v1 direction.

### UX Guardrails (Must Follow)

- One authoritative textual state label (Disconnected, Connecting, Connected, Error). Color is supplemental; text is primary.
- Recovery messaging must be actionable, concise, and deterministic.
- Reconnect is idempotent and safe to invoke from any state (disconnected, error, or connected).

### Command State-Entry Table

| Command    | Valid From States                          | Transition Sequence                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| disconnect | connected, error, connecting, disconnected | → disconnected (idempotent from disconnected)        |
| reconnect  | disconnected, error, connected             | → (teardown) → connecting → connected \| error       |
| reconnect  | connecting (in-flight)                     | → cancel in-flight → connecting → connected \| error |

### Implementation Guidance by File

- package.json
  - Add disconnect and reconnect command contributions.
- package.nls.json
  - Add localized titles for disconnect/reconnect commands and any new static strings.
- src/extension.ts
  - Register disconnect/reconnect commands alongside connect.
  - Share the same connectionStateStore and status indicator.
- src/commands/
  - Add disconnect-command.ts and reconnect-command.ts or equivalent command-level modules following current command runtime style.
  - Reuse endpoint validation helpers from src/config/endpoint-config.ts.
  - Extract showSettingsPrompt and settingsKeyForEndpointFailure from connect-command.ts into a shared command utility (e.g., src/commands/command-utils.ts) so reconnect-command.ts can reuse them without duplication. Update connect-command.ts to import from the shared module.
- src/transport/browser-connect.ts
  - Reuse existing disconnect helpers and active connection tracking.
  - Keep cleanup resilient (non-fatal cleanup errors remain swallowed where appropriate).
- src/transport/connection-state.ts
  - Reuse existing transition helpers or add minimal helper(s) for reconnect/disconnect state sequencing.
- tests/unit/commands/
  - Add command tests for disconnect and reconnect behavior.
- tests/unit/transport/
  - Extend transport tests to cover lifecycle cleanup assumptions as needed.

### Previous Story Intelligence (Story 1.3)

- Reuse existing connection state model and status indicator integration; avoid introducing a second state source.
- Keep target selection profile-owned and deterministic; reconnect should call existing connect path instead of re-implementing target logic.
- Keep categorized diagnostic formatting path through connect-diagnostics and settings prompt behavior.
- Preserve endpoint summary redaction behavior for user-facing messages.
- Story 1.3 added a concurrency guard on connect: early-return when state is `connecting`. Story 1.4 uses cancel+proceed instead of early-return for disconnect/reconnect (see Command State-Entry Table).
- Actual profile files from Story 1.3 are: src/profile/target-profile.ts, src/profile/core-target-profile.ts, and src/profile/profile-types.ts. The Story 1.3 file list reference to `foundry-target-profile.ts` is stale — that file does not exist.

### Git Intelligence Summary (Recent Commits)

- Recent commit history continues story-scoped incremental delivery and cleanup patches:
  - Merge pull request #14 from sylvercode:remove-false-ipv6-only-workaround
  - Add extensionKind patch defered work documentation
  - Simply Start-EdgeDebug script
  - Remove false ipv6 only and locahost only workaround
  - Merge pull request #13 from sylvercode/connect-browser
- Guidance: keep 1.4 implementation tight and localized to lifecycle command/control surfaces plus tests.

### Latest Technical Information

- Current dependency: chrome-remote-interface@^0.34.0.
- Latest published npm version (checked 2026-04-11): 0.34.0.
- No dependency bump is required for this story; prioritize stable lifecycle behavior over package churn.
