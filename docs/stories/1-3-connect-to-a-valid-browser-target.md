# Story 1.3: Connect to a Valid Browser Target

**Status:** done

## Story

As a developer,
I want to initiate connection from VS Code to a valid browser target,
So that I can begin notebook execution quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC 1: Deterministic Connect State Transitions

**Given** valid endpoint configuration
**When** I run Connect
**Then** state transitions deterministically from connecting to connected or error
**And** final state is visible in the status indicator.

### AC 2: Valid Target Selection with Mismatch Category

**Given** multiple browser targets are present
**When** Connect executes
**Then** profile matching selects a valid target or returns target-mismatch
**And** the diagnostic names the failure category.

### AC 3: Actionable Guidance When No Valid Target Exists

**Given** no valid target exists
**When** Connect completes
**Then** an actionable next-step message is shown
**And** suggested actions include target-selection or endpoint checks.

## Tasks / Subtasks

### 1. Connection Lifecycle Baseline in Runtime Code (AC: 1)

- [x] Add a canonical connection-state model using the platform states `disconnected`, `connecting`, `connected`, and `error`.
  - [x] Keep transport lifecycle ownership in runtime code; avoid ad-hoc booleans in command handlers.
  - [x] Ensure every connect attempt emits a deterministic transition sequence.
- [x] Wire `jupyterBrowserKernel.connect` to set `connecting` before transport work begins.
  - [x] Set `connected` only after target attach succeeds.
  - [x] Set `error` for any categorized failure path.

### 2. CDP Browser-Target Connection and Session Attach (AC: 1, 2)

- [x] Implement CDP browser-level connect flow using `chrome-remote-interface` (existing dependency).
  - [x] Resolve browser-level WebSocket URL from `/json/version`.
  - [x] Connect to browser target (not page target) to preserve DevTools coexistence.
- [x] Enumerate targets and apply profile matching.
  - [x] Match only eligible page targets for the active profile.
  - [x] Keep the current core profile broad (`type === page`); defer Foundry-specific URL matching to Epic 7.
  - [x] If one eligible target exists, select it deterministically.
  - [x] If no eligible targets exist, return categorized `target-mismatch`.
- [x] Attach with `Target.attachToTarget({ flatten: true })` and capture `sessionId` for future operations.

### 3. User-Facing Diagnostics and Actionability (AC: 2, 3)

- [x] Add categorized diagnostic output for connect outcomes.
  - [x] Categories must include at minimum: `target-mismatch`, endpoint/connectivity failure, and uncategorized transport failure.
  - [x] Keep user-facing messages state-led and concise.
- [x] For `target-mismatch`, provide concrete next steps.
  - [x] Check browser tab selection / active target context.
  - [x] Verify endpoint host/port configuration.
  - [x] Confirm at least one browser page target is available to CDP.
- [x] Continue to redact sensitive endpoint details in user-facing errors.

### 4. Status Indicator Surface (AC: 1)

- [x] Implement one authoritative status indicator for connection state.
  - [x] Labels: `Disconnected`, `Connecting`, `Connected`, `Error`.
  - [x] Keep text as the primary signal; color is supplemental only.
- [x] Ensure final state is always visible after Connect completes (success or failure).

### 5. Tests and Regression Coverage (AC: 1, 2, 3)

- [x] Add unit tests for state transition sequencing around connect.
  - [x] Happy path: `disconnected -> connecting -> connected`.
  - [x] Failure path: `disconnected -> connecting -> error`.
- [x] Add unit tests for target selection/matching logic.
  - [x] Selects deterministic eligible target when multiple targets exist.
  - [x] Returns `target-mismatch` when no target matches.
- [x] Add unit tests for diagnostic messaging.
  - [x] Failure category is included in diagnostic output.
  - [x] `target-mismatch` guidance includes actionable next steps.
- [x] Keep tests under top-level `tests/` folders, not under `src/`.

### Review Findings

- [x] [Review][Decision] No concurrency guard on rapid connect invocations — Resolved: added early-return in `executeConnectCommand` when state is `connecting`.
- [x] [Review][Patch] Status indicator labels bypass localization — Resolved: replaced `labelByState` map with `localizedLabel()` switch using `vscodeApi.l10n.t`.
- [x] [Review][Patch] Connect failure always routes to `cdpHost` settings key — Resolved: routes `endpoint-connectivity` failures to `cdpPort` settings key, others to `cdpHost`.
- [x] [Review][Patch] Partial attach leaves potential orphaned CDP session on probe failure — Resolved: `connectViaBrowserTargetAttach` now calls `Target.detachFromTarget({ sessionId })` before closing the client when the runtime probe fails.
- [x] [Review][Defer] `connectionStateStore.getState()` is unused interface surface — `getState()` is defined on `ConnectionStateStore` but never called in command or extension code. State is pushed via callbacks, not pulled. Deferred, benign unused API.

## Dev Notes

### Story Context and Scope

- This story is the first real transport connection story after endpoint configuration hardening.
- Story 1.2 already validates endpoint values and provides field-specific remediation. Reuse that validation path; do not duplicate config validation logic.
- Connect remains the only contributed lifecycle command at this point. Reconnect/disconnect controls are separate stories.

### Architecture Guardrails (Must Follow)

- Keep runtime JavaScript-only execution direction (v1 scope).
- Preserve extension activation scope on `onCommand:jupyterBrowserKernel.connect`.
- Preserve transport/profile separation:
  - Transport owns connection lifecycle.
  - Profile owns target matching/eligibility semantics.
- Use normalized, categorized failures instead of leaking raw protocol errors.
- Keep manual reconnect as future story behavior; do not add auto-reconnect in this story.

### CDP and DevTools Coexistence Requirements

- Connect through browser-level CDP WebSocket (`/json/version` -> `webSocketDebuggerUrl`) rather than page-level WS endpoints.
- Use flat sessions (`flatten: true`) when attaching to target.
- Use session-scoped command/event paths for future safety; avoid APIs that cannot scope by `sessionId`.
- Preserve coexistence with active DevTools sessions; do not introduce forced disconnect behavior.

### Implementation Shape in Current Repository

- Current runtime code is concentrated in:
  - `src/extension.ts`
  - `src/commands/connect-command.ts`
  - `src/config/endpoint-config.ts`
- Introduce only the minimum new modules needed to support this story, for example:
  - `src/transport/*` for CDP connection and target attach behavior
  - `src/profile/*` for profile-owned target matching rules
  - `src/ui/*` for status indicator state mapping
- Keep file naming kebab-case and avoid speculative folder sprawl.

### Testing Requirements

- Prioritize deterministic unit tests for:
  - connection state transitions,
  - target selection classification,
  - diagnostic category and message content.
- If integration coverage is added, keep it fixture-driven and deterministic; do not rely on brittle live browser assumptions for baseline CI reliability.
- Place all tests in top-level tests directories (for example `tests/unit`, `tests/integration`) to align with project architecture constraints.

### Manual Test Checklist

- [x] Set valid endpoint (`jupyterBrowserKernel.cdpHost`, `jupyterBrowserKernel.cdpPort`) and run connect.
  - [x] Confirm status changes to `Connecting`, then `Connected` on success.
- [x] With browser reachable but no page targets available to CDP, run connect.
  - [x] Confirm final status `Error`.
  - [x] Confirm diagnostic includes `target-mismatch` category and actionable next steps.
- [x] With invalid endpoint settings, run connect.
  - [x] Confirm existing endpoint validation (Story 1.2) blocks before transport attempts.
- [x] With multiple page targets available, run connect.
  - [x] Confirm deterministic target selection behavior and stable final state.
- [x] Attach Edge/DevTools to the same browser context and rerun connect.
  - [x] Confirm no forced disconnect behavior is introduced.

### Previous Story Intelligence (Story 1.2)

- Reuse existing endpoint validation contract from `src/config/endpoint-config.ts` and command runtime wiring in `src/commands/connect-command.ts`.
- Preserve deterministic and actionable error language patterns already established.
- Keep endpoint redaction behavior (`summarizeEndpointForDisplay`) for user-facing diagnostics.
- Keep settings namespace and command naming stable (`jupyterBrowserKernel.*`, `jupyterBrowserKernel.connect`).

### Git Intelligence Summary (Recent Commits)

- Recent work pattern is story-driven, with implementation + tests + docs/sprint status updates in lockstep.
- Endpoint validation and connect command scaffolding were recently hardened; this story should extend rather than replace those foundations.
- Commit trend shows strict incremental delivery: preserve that style and avoid broad speculative refactors.

### Latest Technical Information

- Current repository dependency: `chrome-remote-interface@^0.33.2`.
- Latest published package version: `0.34.0`.
- Guidance for this story:
  - Use latest published package version.
  - If upgrading, include explicit compatibility validation for browser-target connect and `Target.attachToTarget({ flatten: true })` behavior.
