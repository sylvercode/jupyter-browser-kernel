# Deferred Work

## Deferred from: code review of 1-2-configure-browser-endpoint (2026-04-04)

- `isLoopbackHost` does not cover the `127.x.x.x` block or IPv6 variants (`::ffff:127.0.0.1`, `0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1`) — these are displayed as `[redacted-host]` instead of the raw loopback address. Expanded loopback display classification deferred to post-MVP.
- `watchAutoRefreshInterval` is missing `markdownDescription` and min/max schema constraints, unlike its sibling `cdpPort`. Deferred — outside Story 1.2 task scope.
- Generic `"{0} {1}"` l10n key is shared by all two-argument error compositions, limiting targeted translation and key-specific comments. Deferred — not a functional bug, translation quality concern.
- ~~`format` test helper re-implements `vscode.l10n.t` substitution logic.~~ Resolved: replaced with `@vscode/l10n` (the canonical standalone package) imported directly in `tests/unit/commands/connect-command.test.ts`.
- `config.get<string>("cdpHost", ...)` wrapping with `String()` means a corrupted config returning an object would produce `"[object Object]"`, which passes host validation and is used as a hostname. Deferred — VS Code settings infrastructure prevents configuration corruption in practice.

## Deferred from: code review of 1-3-connect-to-a-valid-browser-target (2026-04-08)

- `connectionStateStore.getState()` is unused interface surface — `getState()` is defined on `ConnectionStateStore` but never called in command or extension code. State is pushed via callbacks, not pulled. Benign unused API.
- `extensionKind` in `package.json` is set to `"ui"` and `"workspace"` instead of `"ui"` only to make the extention debuggable. When adding CI packaging (**story 1.7**), the `extentionKind` must be patch in the pipeline.

## Deferred from: code review of 1-4-disconnect-and-manual-reconnect-lifecycle (2026-04-11)

- No explicit 5-second timeout wrapper for reconnect (NFR2/NFR4). AC 2 requires "reports success or failure within 5 seconds." Implementation relies on CDP library default timeouts. No `Promise.race` timeout guard. CDP defaults are reasonable for MVP.

## Deferred from: code review of 1-6-surface-connection-state-and-recovery-actions (2026-04-13)

- Timestamp logging uses time-only format (`toLocaleTimeString`) — multi-day sessions produce ambiguous log entries without date context. Pre-existing pattern.
- `endpointSummary()` re-reads workspace configuration on every tooltip render and log line. Harmless at current event frequency but would be wasteful under rapid state changes. Pre-existing pattern.

## Deferred from: code review of 2-2-run-asynchronous-javascript-cells (2026-04-18)

- ~~`raceWithTimeout` never cancels the underlying CDP evaluation — when the timeout fires, the browser continues executing the expression. `Runtime.terminateExecution` could be used for cleanup. Acceptable for MVP scope.~~ Resolved in Story 2.2 by issuing `Runtime.terminateExecution` on timeout.
- Magic string coupling between transport timeout message (`"CDP evaluation timed out"`) and kernel regex (`TIMEOUT_ERROR_PATTERN`) — fragile contract via string matching instead of typed error. Requires design decision on shared error contract.
- `replMode: true` was added to `Runtime.evaluate` params in Story 2.2 without spec authorization. It changes CDP evaluation semantics (top-level await, completion-value return). Flag for Story 2.4 planning to decide whether to keep or remove.

## Deferred from: code review of 2-3-normalize-success-and-failure-output-contracts (2026-04-19)

- No test for Symbol/Function without `description` field — CDP can theoretically return symbols/functions where `description` is undefined, causing `serializeRemoteValue` fallthrough to `JSON.stringify(undefined)` → `"undefined"`. CDP always provides `description` for these types in practice.

## Deferred from: breakpoint compatibility discovery (2026-04-19)

- `addSourceLabeling` uses a static `//# sourceURL=cell.js` for all cells. Must be replaced with per-cell identity reflecting notebook file name and cell index (e.g., `notebook-name.cell-3.js`). Deferred to Story 2.4 — sourceURL scheme should be designed alongside wrapping lambda and breakpoint-compatibility decisions.
- Breakpoint debugging was identified as an implicit MVP capability not covered by any existing FR or epic. Browser-level breakpoints require CDP `Debugger` domain integration and a stable source-name contract between VS Code notebook URIs and `sourceURL` directives. Run Correct Course (`bmad-correct-course`) before starting Story 2.4 to integrate this into PRD, architecture, and epic planning.
