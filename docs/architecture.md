# Architecture Decision Document

_This document builds collaboratively through step-by-step discovery. Sections are appended as we work through each architectural decision together._

## Project Context Analysis

### Requirements Overview

**Functional Requirements:**
The requirement set defines a clear two-layer architecture. The core layer owns browser session lifecycle, JavaScript notebook execution, normalized result contracts, intentional output handling, execution history, reconnect operations, and deterministic testing. A separate profile layer owns target-matching policies, eligibility diagnostics, runtime envelope details, and profile-specific workflows.

The FR structure also enforces stability boundaries:

- Core execution semantics must remain consistent regardless of transport details.
- Profile behaviors must remain additive and not leak into core runtime assumptions.
- Post-MVP capability expansion (watchers, prompts, reusable actions) extends existing contracts rather than replacing them.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
The NFRs are architecture-driving and measurable:

- Performance: render and reconnect responsiveness targets.
- Reliability: explicit failure surfacing and parity across execution paths.
- Integration: DevTools coexistence, profile-owned eligibility checks, adapter-agnostic core.
- Security: user-configured endpoint boundaries, no secret persistence by default, safe diagnostics.
- Verification: deterministic fixture coverage for success, syntax/runtime errors, reconnect states, and serialization boundaries.

**Scale and Complexity:**
This is a medium-complexity platform foundation project with high precision requirements in runtime contracts and operational behavior.

- Primary domain: VS Code extension and browser execution kernel platform
- Complexity level: medium
- Estimated architectural components: 9

### Technical Constraints and Dependencies

- Runtime scope is JavaScript-only for v1.
- VS Code extension APIs and notebook workflow are the host boundary.
- Browser execution currently depends on CDP capabilities and coexistence-safe session orchestration.
- Direct transport details must remain replaceable behind a stable execution contract.
- Manual reconnect is required for MVP; automatic reconnect is deferred.
- Serialization limits require shallow value strategies and intentional drill-down patterns.
- Core and profile responsibilities must remain strictly separated to prevent scope and coupling regressions.

### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified

- Connection-state and target-eligibility state modeling
- Result normalization contract across all execution outcomes
- Intentional output discrimination from ambient browser noise
- Diagnostics quality, actionability, and sensitive-data redaction
- DevTools coexistence guarantees under active execution
- Transport abstraction and future transport migration safety
- Deterministic automated validation via static browser fixtures
- Reversible experimentation workflow support (forward and rollback cells)

## Starter Template Evaluation

### Primary Technology Domain

VS Code extension platform on Node.js, TypeScript-only.

### Starter Options Considered

| Option                  | Version                          | Status        | Notes                                               |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Yeoman + generator-code | yo@7.0.0, generator-code@1.11.18 | ✅ Selected   | Updated Feb 2026, official VS Code recommended path |
| create-vscode-extension | 0.1.3                            | ❌ Eliminated | Last updated 2022, stale and unmaintained           |
| Manual scaffold         | —                                | ❌ Not chosen | Highest effort, lowest leverage                     |

### Selected Starter: Yeoman + generator-code (TypeScript + esbuild + ESM)

**Initialization Command:**

```bash
npx --package yo --package generator-code -- yo code --extensionType ts --bundler esbuild --pkgManager npm --skipOpen
```

Followed by configuring ESM output in `tsconfig.json` and esbuild config.

### Module System Decision: ESM

| Factor                               | CommonJS                       | ESM                                         |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| VS Code extension host compatibility | Proven, no edge cases          | Requires validation in early implementation |
| TypeScript output                    | `module: commonjs`             | `module: esnext` or `module: node16`        |
| Import semantics                     | `require()` / `module.exports` | `import` / `export`                         |
| Bundler support                      | Universal                      | esbuild handles natively                    |
| Future compatibility                 | Legacy model                   | Modern standard                             |
| Project preference                   | —                              | ✅ Explicit user preference                 |

**Decision: ESM** — with an explicit compatibility checkpoint in the first implementation story to validate extension-host loading, test runner integration, and esbuild bundle output.

### Architectural Decisions Derived from Starter

- **Language:** TypeScript strict mode (`"strict": true`)
- **Build system:** esbuild, ESM output target
- **Runtime:** VS Code extension host (Node.js)
- **Distribution:** Local/dev only for MVP — no Marketplace publishing
- **Packaging:** `@vscode/vsce@3.7.1` available when Marketplace distribution is needed post-MVP
- **Testing:** Modern tooling preferred; `@vscode/test-cli@0.0.12` available as primary test runner candidate

> **Implementation Note:** Project initialization using the command above is the first implementation story. The ESM compatibility checkpoint is part of that story's acceptance criteria.

## Core Architectural Decisions

### Decision Priority Analysis

Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):

- Transport architecture: Direct CDP for MVP through browser-level WebSocket multiplexing with flat sessions.
- Result contract: Discriminated union with strict success/error parity.
- Connection lifecycle: Transport-owned connection state machine with manual reconnect only.

Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):

- Module decomposition: Clear core/kernel, transport, profile, notebook, and UI boundaries.
- Execution envelope: Hybrid strategy where kernel owns canonical envelope and normalization while profile can inject controlled hooks.
- Profile boundary: Capability-negotiated profile interface with minimal default capability surface.
- Testing strategy: Layered deterministic strategy spanning unit, contract, integration, and extension-host tests.

Deferred Decisions (Post-MVP):

- Alternate transport implementations beyond CDP (for example browser extension bridge).
- Advanced output channels and deeper inspect capabilities not required for MVP.
- Expanded profile capability negotiation beyond baseline execution and handshake needs.

### Data Architecture

- No application database is required for MVP.
- Persistent storage is limited to local extension state where necessary for UX continuity, not domain data modeling.
- No migration framework is required for MVP scope.
- Caching is in-memory only and bounded to session/runtime concerns.

### Authentication and Security

- No user authentication or authorization layer in MVP scope.
- Security model centers on local development usage with explicit user-controlled browser endpoint configuration.
- No secret persistence by default.
- Diagnostics must redact sensitive endpoint details where applicable.
- Transport boundary prevents leaking raw protocol errors outside normalized contracts.

### API and Communication Patterns

- Internal API style is interface-first TypeScript contracts between kernel, transport, and profile boundaries.
- External communication in MVP is transport-driven command/evaluate flows over CDP.
- Error handling standard is normalized execution results only:
  - success branch with value and representation
  - failure branch with name, message, optional stack, and failure kind
- No network rate-limiting strategy is required for MVP because communication is local and session-scoped.
- Version-verified toolchain references:
  - chrome-remote-interface: 0.34.0 (modified 2026-02-09)
  - vitest: 4.1.0 (modified 2026-03-12)
  - @vscode/test-cli: 0.0.12 (modified 2025-10-09)

### Debugger Domain Integration

The kernel must support source-level breakpoint debugging from the browser's developer-tools Sources panel. This is a cross-layer contract spanning transport, kernel, and notebook layers.

Per-cell source identity contract:

- Every evaluated cell carries a `//# sourceURL=` directive that is unique per cell and stable across re-execution within a session.
- The directive is derived from the notebook URI and the cell index. The exact format is implementation-scoped within Story 2.5 but must satisfy the properties required for FR38 breakpoint binding to work: uniqueness per cell (so a breakpoint binds to one cell, not all cells sharing a name), stability across reruns of the same cell (so a breakpoint persists through edit-run cycles), and human-readable association with the notebook file (so the user can locate the cell source in the browser's Sources panel to set the breakpoint in the first place).
- The notebook controller layer is the source of the notebook URI; the kernel applies the directive; the transport carries it unmodified.

Debugger lifecycle:

- The transport exposes a `BrowserDebuggerSession` surface on `ActiveBrowserConnection.debugger` (introduced by Story 2.5) that wraps the per-target flat session and surfaces `setBreakpointByUrl`, `removeBreakpoint`, `resume`, `onPaused`, and the additional commands required by Epic 10. This surface is the single channel through which higher layers reach the Debugger domain — direct `client.send("Debugger.*", …)` calls outside the transport are forbidden.
- `Debugger.enable` is NOT called at session attach. The DAP session manager (Epic 10, Story 10.1) is the sole owner of `Debugger.enable` / `Debugger.disable`, scoped to the lifetime of an active `vscode.DebugSession`. Outside an active debug session, the extension's per-target session does not receive `Debugger.paused` events, which removes the need for any always-on auto-resume behavior.
- Breakpoint authoring lives in VS Code (notebook-cell gutter breakpoints). The DAP adapter (Story 10.2) translates DAP `setBreakpoints` requests into `Debugger.setBreakpointByUrl` calls keyed off `cell.document.uri.toString()` — the same value Story 2.4 emits as `//# sourceURL=`. There is no always-on `vscode.debug.onDidChangeBreakpoints` mirror; breakpoint sync is driven by DAP requests during an active debug session only.
- Browser-side breakpoints set directly in the Sources panel continue to fire without extension involvement, because the sourceURL contract is honored.
- Pause ownership during a debug session belongs to the DAP adapter: it receives `Debugger.paused`, emits the DAP `stopped` event, and only resumes when VS Code issues `continue`/`next`/`stepIn`/`stepOut`. DevTools coexistence is preserved by the flat-session multiplex (Spike Q3) — DevTools' own session retains independent pause/step control.
- Post-MVP core (FR39) is delivered by Epic 10 (DAP adapter). The adapter must preserve CDP flat-session coexistence and must not regress external DevTools interoperability.

Debug-session-driven connection lifecycle (Epic 11, FR40):

- Post-MVP core (FR40) shifts the connection-lifecycle delivery surface from standalone commands to the VS Code debug session. The debug session becomes the primary owner of connect/reconnect/disconnect: debug start = connect, debug restart = reconnect, debug stop/terminate = disconnect. This supersedes (and retires) the `jupyterBrowserKernel.connect` / `disconnect` / `reconnect` commands delivered in Epic 1, while the underlying transport-owned connection state machine and FR4 state reporting are preserved.
- Connection endpoints are configured as debug configurations: the `jupyter-browser-kernel` debugger `configurationAttributes` carry `host` and `port`. This enables multiple named, version-controlled connection profiles per project (`launch.json`), with the Run and Debug picker acting as the connection selector. The single active-connection constraint (one module-level `activeBrowserConnection`) is unchanged: many profiles may be defined, but only one is active at a time, and a second concurrent debug session is rejected with guidance.
- Workspace settings `jupyterBrowserKernel.cdpHost` / `cdpPort` are retained only as fallback defaults: a debug configuration that omits `host`/`port` resolves the missing value from settings, preserving zero-config launch. The debug-configuration values take precedence when present.
- Notebook execution is coupled to the debug session: running a browser-kernel cell with no active session prompts the user to start the default or user-selected connection debug configuration (via `vscode.debug.startDebugging`); the debugger is not booted silently. The kernel continues to execute against the transport-owned `ActiveBrowserConnection`; ownership of when that connection exists moves to the debug session lifecycle.\n- Activation: the notebook controller registration is connection-independent and already happens in `activate()`, but retiring the connect command removes the implicit `onCommand:jupyterBrowserKernel.connect` activation that today bootstraps the extension in normal use. Epic 11 adds `onNotebook:jupyter-notebook` to `activationEvents` so opening a Jupyter notebook activates the extension and registers the Browser Kernel controller — making the kernel selectable and cell-run-driven session auto-start possible without first starting a debug session or invoking a command.
- DevTools coexistence requirements (NFR8) are unchanged: debug stop disconnects only the extension's flat session and browser-level WebSocket as today, and must not force-detach external DevTools.

Evaluation strategy and `replMode`:

- Story 2.2 introduced `replMode: true` to enable top-level await. `replMode` may interfere with breakpoint binding because it wraps the expression in an IIFE.
- Story 2.5 must validate `replMode` empirically. If breakpoints do not bind reliably, the evaluation path switches to `Runtime.compileScript` + `Runtime.runScript` (or another validated alternative) while preserving top-level await semantics.
- This decision is recorded in Story 2.5; the architecture commits only to: top-level await must survive, and breakpoints must bind.

Wrapping-lambda line offset:

- Story 2.4 introduces a wrapping lambda for variable-creation control. The wrapper prepends a known number of lines before user code.
- The sourceURL directive emission and any synthesized lines must keep user line N mapped to user line N in the source visible to the debugger. Mechanisms include: emitting the sourceURL after a leading newline budget, using `//# sourceURL` placement that does not shift user lines, or using source mappings if needed.
- Story 2.5 owns the validation test that proves user-visible line numbers match Sources-panel line numbers.

DevTools coexistence interaction:

- The browser-level CDP multiplexing already used to coexist with DevTools is sufficient. `Debugger.enable` invoked from the extension's flat session does not displace or interfere with DevTools' own debugger session.

### Frontend Architecture

- VS Code extension UI surface only (status and diagnostics), no standalone frontend app.
- State ownership is explicit:
  - transport state machine for connection lifecycle
  - profile state machine for post-connect environment readiness
- Notebook output rendering consumes normalized kernel results only.
- No additional bundle-optimization strategy beyond starter esbuild setup is required in MVP.

### Infrastructure and Deployment

- Local and development-only distribution for MVP.
- Build system: TypeScript strict + esbuild with ESM output.
- CI can be introduced with compile, lint, and test gates, but marketplace release automation is deferred.
- Monitoring/logging is local diagnostic-first and actionability-focused.
- Scaling strategy for MVP is single-user local workflow; horizontal runtime scaling is out of scope.

### Decision Impact Analysis

Implementation Sequence:

1. Establish transport abstractions and transport-owned connection state machine.
2. Implement CDP transport (direct CDP) with flat session orchestration.
3. Implement kernel execution pipeline with canonical envelope and normalized result union.
4. Define profile interface and profile-owned state machine, then implement baseline generic profile.
5. Integrate notebook controller and UI diagnostics/status surfaces.
6. Build deterministic layered tests with fixture-driven browser integration and extension-host coverage.

Cross-Component Dependencies:

- Kernel depends on transport and profile interfaces, not implementations.
- Profile depends on transport-provided target/session handles but does not manage raw transport lifecycle.
- UI and notebook layers depend only on kernel-facing contracts and normalized state/results.
- Transport substitution is enabled by interface boundaries, preserving kernel behavior and tests.

## Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules

### Pattern Categories Defined

Critical conflict points identified: 5 major areas where AI agents could make different choices and create integration friction:

- Naming and symbol style drift
- Layer boundary and file placement drift
- Result/error/data format drift
- Event/log/state communication drift
- Process and validation timing drift

### Naming Patterns

Database Naming Conventions:

- No application database conventions required for MVP.
- If persistence is introduced later, naming rules must be added before implementation.

API Naming Conventions:

- External API surface is not a primary project concern in MVP; internal contract naming is mandatory.
- Internal contract fields use camelCase.
- Error kind literals use kebab-case (for example: syntax-error, transport-error).

Code Naming Conventions:

- File names: kebab-case (for example: execution-kernel.ts, cdp-transport.ts).
- Types, classes, and interfaces: PascalCase (for example: ExecutionKernel, ITransport).
- Functions and variables: camelCase.
- Constants and env keys: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.
- Avoid alias names for core concepts; one canonical name per concept across layers.

### Structure Patterns

Project Organization:

- Unit and contract tests must live outside source folders in dedicated tests folders.
- Integration fixtures must live under tests/fixtures.
- Extension-host test entry points must live under tests (not under source).
- Source folders must contain runtime code only.

File Structure Patterns:

- No cross-layer imports that violate architecture boundaries:
  - kernel cannot import concrete transport and profile implementations
  - ui and notebook cannot import transport directly
- Transport implementations stay in transport; profile implementations stay in profile.
- Shared helper utilities must be explicitly scoped (kernel helper, transport helper, profile helper) rather than generic dumping grounds.
- Prefer narrow exports; avoid broad wildcard re-export patterns that blur boundaries.

### Format Patterns

API Response Formats:

- Execution and evaluation results must always use the normalized discriminated union contract.
- Raw transport and protocol errors must never leak beyond transport boundary.
- Success and failure branches must be exhaustive and type-checkable.

Data Exchange Formats:

- Runtime payload fields use camelCase.
- Date and time values use ISO-8601 strings.
- Error payload shape is normalized: { name, message, stack?, kind }.
- Nullability must be explicit in types; avoid implicit undefined contracts for required fields.

### Communication Patterns

Event System Patterns:

- Internal events use dot.case naming (for example: transport.connected, profile.handshake.ok).
- Event payloads must have stable typed interfaces.
- Event names reflect domain ownership (transport._, profile._, kernel.\*).

State Management Patterns:

- Connection lifecycle state is transport-owned.
- Post-connect readiness and compatibility state is profile-owned.
- Kernel consumes state from transport and profile interfaces and must not duplicate independent ad-hoc lifecycle flags.
- UI surfaces derive state from canonical state machines, not inferred booleans.

### Process Patterns

Error Handling Patterns:

- Normalize all execution outcomes before returning to notebook and UI layers.
- Separate diagnostic detail for logs from user-facing message text.
- Enforce deterministic failure-kind mapping for syntax, runtime, transport, and limit paths.
- Preserve actionable error context while redacting sensitive endpoint details when needed.

Loading State Patterns:

- Loading states come from state machines and operation status, not manually scattered booleans.
- Manual reconnect only for MVP.
- Validation timing must be consistent:
  - transport validation at connect
  - profile handshake after connect
  - envelope and result validation before notebook output render

### Enforcement Guidelines

All AI Agents MUST:

- Follow naming and file placement rules exactly.
- Respect layer boundaries and import constraints.
- Return normalized result and error formats only.
- Place all tests under dedicated tests folders outside source.
- Add or update tests for each feature touching kernel, transport, or profile behavior.

Pattern Enforcement:

- Enforce via lint rules, TypeScript strict mode, and review checklist gates.
- Reject pull requests that introduce cross-layer import violations or unnormalized results.
- Document violations in review comments with exact rule references.
- Update this pattern section before adopting any intentional convention change.

### Pattern Examples

Good Examples:

- tests/unit/execution-kernel.test.ts
- tests/contract/transport-contract.test.ts
- tests/integration/fixtures/runtime-error.html
- transport.connected event with typed payload
- Normalized failure: { ok: false, name: "TypeError", message: "...", kind: "runtime-error" }

Anti-Patterns:

- Source-co-located tests (for example: src/kernel/execution-kernel.test.ts)
- Kernel importing CdpTransport directly
- UI importing transport implementation directly
- Throwing raw protocol errors past transport boundary
- Mixed naming styles for same concept across modules

### Architectural Boundaries

API Boundaries:

- Extension command and notebook entry points are exposed only through extension and notebook layers.
- No external network API boundary is required for MVP.
- Transport protocol details are hidden behind transport interfaces.

Component Boundaries:

- Kernel communicates with transport and profile through interfaces only.
- Notebook and UI consume kernel outputs and state, not transport internals.
- Profile owns target selection and post-connect readiness; transport owns connection lifecycle.

Service Boundaries:

- Transport service: session lifecycle, connection state, protocol execution.
- Profile service: target resolution, handshake and readiness checks, profile capabilities.
- Kernel service: execution orchestration, envelope application, result normalization.

Data Boundaries:

- No persistent domain database boundary in MVP.
- Runtime data contracts are typed and normalized at kernel boundary.
- Diagnostics data is redacted before user-facing output.

### Requirements to Structure Mapping

Feature and FR Mapping:

- Connection lifecycle and reconnect requirements: src/transport plus src/ui/status-bar and tests/integration/reconnect.
- Execution result normalization requirements: src/kernel/execution-result and tests/unit/kernel plus tests/fixtures.
- Profile eligibility and handshake requirements: src/profile and tests/contract/profile.
- Notebook execution workflow requirements: src/notebook plus tests/integration/notebook-flow.
- DevTools coexistence and CDP multiplexing requirements: src/transport/cdp-\* and tests/integration/browser-cdp.

Cross-Cutting Concerns:

- Error normalization and redaction: src/shared/types/error-types and src/shared/utils/redact.
- State consistency: transport and profile state machine modules.
- Output consistency: src/kernel/output-collector and src/notebook/output-renderer.

### Integration Points

Internal Communication:

- extension initializes composition root and wires interfaces.
- notebook and ui subscribe to kernel-facing state and results.
- kernel calls transport and profile contracts and returns normalized outputs.

External Integrations:

- Chromium CDP endpoint through chrome-remote-interface in transport layer.
- VS Code extension APIs and notebook controller APIs in extension and notebook layers.

Data Flow:

1. User triggers notebook execution.
2. Kernel requests transport readiness and profile execution plan.
3. Kernel runs canonical envelope with controlled profile hooks.
4. Transport executes against active session.
5. Kernel normalizes success or failure result.
6. Notebook and UI render normalized output and diagnostics.

### File Organization Patterns

Configuration Files:

- Root-level toolchain and extension config files.
- Runtime defaults and extension setting access in src/config.

Source Organization:

- Layered structure by architectural responsibility, not by ad-hoc feature dumping.
- Shared folder limited to cross-layer types and utilities only.

Test Organization:

- All tests live in top-level tests folders outside source.
- Unit, contract, integration, extension-host, fixtures, and test-utils are isolated by purpose.

Asset Organization:

- Fixture assets and HTML pages live in tests/fixtures.
- No mixed runtime assets under source unless explicitly required by extension packaging.

### Development Workflow Integration

Development Server Structure:

- Watch and compile run against source layers; tests run from dedicated tests tree.

Build Process Structure:

- esbuild produces dist output from extension entry while preserving layer boundaries in source.

Deployment Structure:

- Local and dev-focused packaging from dist output with extension metadata at root.

## Architecture Validation Results

### Coherence Validation ✅

**Decision Compatibility:**
All technology choices are compatible and version-verified. TypeScript strict + esbuild ESM output + VS Code extension host form a proven toolchain. chrome-remote-interface@0.34.0 operates behind `ITransport`, keeping the kernel independent of protocol choice. vitest@4.1.0 and @vscode/test-cli@0.0.12 cover separate test layers without overlap or conflict. The discriminated union result contract fits naturally with TypeScript exhaustive type narrowing. No contradictory decisions were found.

**Pattern Consistency:**
Implementation patterns support architectural decisions uniformly. Naming conventions (kebab-case files, PascalCase types, camelCase functions, dot.case events) apply consistently across kernel, transport, profile, notebook, and UI layers. The event domain-ownership convention (`transport.*`, `profile.*`, `kernel.*`) aligns directly with the module decomposition. Normalized result and error formats use the same discriminated union shape at every boundary. Tests-outside-source rule is enforced by directory structure.

**Structure Alignment:**
The project structure fully supports architectural decisions. `src/transport/` owns `connection-state-machine.ts` and `i-transport.ts`, matching the transport-owned lifecycle decision. `src/profile/` owns `profile-state-machine.ts` and `i-profile.ts`, matching the profile-owned readiness decision. Kernel depends only on interfaces, and notebook/UI layers consume only kernel outputs. Boundary isolation is structural, not advisory. The `tests/` tree mirrors the layered testing strategy exactly: unit, contract, integration, extension-host, and fixtures all have dedicated locations.

### Requirements Coverage Validation ✅

**Epic/Feature Coverage:**
The architecture supports all MVP platform capabilities: connection and session control, notebook execution, normalized result contract, output discrimination, execution history, manual reconnect, and deterministic fixture-based testing. Profile-specific and post-MVP capabilities are scoped to dedicated profile boundaries and capability negotiation without contaminating core kernel modules.

**Functional Requirements Coverage:**

- FR1-FR7 (Connection and Session Control) are covered by `src/transport/`, `src/config/`, and `src/ui/status-bar`.
- FR8-FR13, FR38 (Notebook Execution including breakpoint debugging) are covered by `src/kernel/`, `src/notebook/`, and `src/transport/` debugger-domain enablement.
- FR14-FR17 (Result and Output Contract) are covered by `src/kernel/execution-result`, `src/kernel/output-collector`, and shared error/event types.
- FR18 (Platform Testing and Validation) is covered by `tests/fixtures/`, `tests/integration/`, and `tests/contract/`.
- FR19-FR22 (Experimentation Workflow and install path) are supported by notebook execution flow and session lifecycle design.
- FR23 (Extension-owned output helpers) is covered by kernel envelope and profile hook strategy under architecture-scoped helper conventions.
- FR24-FR37 (Post-MVP) are accommodated through capability-negotiated profile interfaces and explicit deferred architectural slots.

**Non-Functional Requirements Coverage:**

- NFR1-NFR3 (Performance) are supported by a shallow execution pipeline and explicit state-driven flow.
- NFR4-NFR6 (Reliability and parity) are supported by transport connection-state management and discriminated union normalization with deterministic fixtures.
- NFR7-NFR9 (Integration and contracts) are supported by adapter-agnostic core boundaries, DevTools coexistence strategy, and deterministic profile diagnostics.
- NFR10-NFR11 (Post-MVP profile eligibility specifics) are structurally supported via profile state machine and capability model.
- NFR12-NFR14 (Testing and validation) are supported by layered test architecture and dedicated fixture suites.
- NFR15-NFR17 (Security and diagnostics) are covered by user-configured endpoints, no secret persistence by default, and redaction-oriented diagnostic utilities.

### Implementation Readiness Validation ✅

**Decision Completeness:**
All implementation-blocking decisions are documented with specific direction and version anchors where required. The architecture provides unambiguous ownership boundaries for transport, profile, kernel, notebook, and UI responsibilities. Consistency rules are explicit enough to reduce AI-agent divergence.

**Structure Completeness:**
The project structure defines all key source and test areas needed for implementation kickoff. Module boundaries, integration points, and data flow are clearly specified. There are no missing top-level domains that would block initial implementation.

**Pattern Completeness:**
Naming, structure, format, communication, and process patterns are all defined with enforcement guidance and anti-pattern examples. Known conflict points are covered, including result normalization, state ownership, and test placement.

### Gap Analysis Results

**Critical Gaps:**

- None.

**Important Gaps:**

- None.

**Nice-to-Have Gaps:**

- Future CI workflow detail (exact job matrix and gating thresholds) can be elaborated in implementation stories.
- Additional concrete examples for post-MVP profile capability negotiation could be added later for onboarding speed.

## Epic 10 Addendum: Full VS Code Debugging Experience

### Scope Alignment

This addendum formalizes post-MVP core architecture decisions for FR39 and Epic 10 so notebook-cell debugging becomes a first-class VS Code-native experience through a dedicated DAP adapter while preserving existing CDP multiplexing and browser DevTools coexistence.

### Architectural Decisions

- Introduce a dedicated debug-adapter layer under core platform boundaries rather than embedding DAP concerns in notebook or transport modules.
- Keep transport as the single owner of CDP session routing and browser attachment lifecycle; the DAP adapter consumes transport services, never bypasses them.
- Use notebook-cell URI/source identity as the canonical breakpoint key, preserving stability across reruns.
- Keep debugger pause ownership in VS Code debug UX for Epic 10 paths; do not mirror paused-state UI into notebook output channels.
- Maintain deterministic event ordering contracts between runtime pause/resume events and DAP stopped/continued events.

### New Module Boundaries

Add the DAP boundary inside the existing `src/debugger/` folder (created by Story 2.5; the always-on mirror module is decommissioned by Story 10.1):

- src/debugger/
  - debug-session-manager.ts (DAP session bootstrap, `Debugger.enable`/`disable` ownership, teardown, reconnect-safe lifecycle)
  - notebook-dap-adapter.ts (DAP request/response/event orchestration)
  - breakpoint-registry.ts (DAP `setBreakpoints` ↔ `Debugger.setBreakpointByUrl` reconciliation, runtime breakpoint id mapping)
  - stackframe-mapper.ts (runtime frame to notebook-cell source mapping)
  - variable-store.ts (stable variable handles, scope paging, defensive expansion)
  - stepping-controller.ts (continue/next/stepIn/stepOut command routing)
  - pause-event-serializer.ts (deterministic ordering and dedupe)
  - index.ts

Integration rules:

- src/notebook may request debug run lifecycle but must not implement DAP protocol details.
- src/transport remains the only module issuing raw debugger-domain CDP commands. The `BrowserDebuggerSession` surface on `ActiveBrowserConnection.debugger` is extended (not duplicated) for the additional commands Epic 10 needs (`getCallStack`, `getProperties`, `evaluateOnCallFrame`, `stepOver`/`stepInto`/`stepOut`, etc.).
- src/debugger must consume `BrowserDebuggerSession` and shared normalized error helpers; it must not import `chrome-remote-interface` directly.
- Story 2.5's `src/debugger/breakpoint-mirror.ts` and its `connectionStateStore`-driven wiring are removed by Story 10.1 — they are superseded by the DAP-owned breakpoint registry.

### Story-to-Architecture Mapping

Story 10.1 (bootstrap and teardown):

- debug-session-manager owns adapter startup, failure diagnostics, and deterministic resource disposal.
- debug-session-manager owns `Debugger.enable` on session start and `Debugger.disable` on session end (transferred from Story 2.5's always-on attach-time enablement).
- Story 10.1 decommissions Story 2.5's `src/debugger/breakpoint-mirror.ts`, removes its wiring from `src/extension.ts`, and removes the unconditional `Debugger.enable` call from `connectViaBrowserTargetAttach`.
- session restart after stop must be explicit and idempotent.

Story 10.2 (breakpoint verification and binding):

- breakpoint-registry translates DAP setBreakpoints to runtime breakpoints using canonical notebook-cell source URLs.
- verified breakpoint responses must include mapped runtime line confirmation.
- stale runtime breakpoints are removed on every sync pass.

Story 10.3 (stack/scopes/variables):

- stackframe-mapper normalizes runtime frames to notebook-cell source coordinates.
- variable-store issues stable integer handles and enforces bounded expansion behavior.
- unsupported runtime values return explicit diagnostic placeholders, never adapter crashes.

Story 10.4 (stepping and lifecycle sync):

- stepping-controller maps DAP control requests to runtime debugger commands.
- pause-event-serializer enforces ordered stopped and continued delivery to avoid duplicate/orphan VS Code states.

Story 10.5 (dual-client coexistence):

- multiplexed flat-session strategy remains mandatory and unchanged.
- adapter must never force-detach peer debugger clients.
- pause handling must avoid deadlock by ensuring adapter state transitions are non-blocking and resumable.
- **Verified by** `tests/integration/debugger/dual-client-coexistence.integration.test.ts` (Story 10.5, gated by `RUN_CDP_INTEGRATION=1`). The test opens two independent flat CDP sessions against the same browser target — one for the adapter and one acting as "DevTools" — and asserts that resuming or disconnecting the adapter session leaves the second session fully operational. This directly validates the Spike Q3 multiplexing pattern documented in [spike/cdp-multiplex-findings.md](../spike/cdp-multiplex-findings.md).
- **Known limitation**: Browser DevTools does not display breakpoint markers in its Sources panel for breakpoints set by the adapter via `Debugger.setBreakpointByUrl`. The breakpoint fires correctly at runtime; only the DevTools UI glyph is missing. This is an inherent property of the CDP breakpoint model and is documented in the Debugger Domain Integration section above.

### Runtime Contracts

Debugger session contract:

- One active DAP session per debug run target in extension scope.
- Session startup either reaches ready state with verified breakpoints or fails loudly with actionable diagnostics.

Breakpoint contract:

- Canonical key: notebook cell source identity from sourceURL-compatible URI.
- Line mapping must preserve user-visible line semantics despite wrapper code.
- Breakpoint enable, disable, edit, and removal are idempotent operations.

Pause/step contract:

- Runtime paused events map to exactly one DAP stopped event.
- Resume/step commands emit continued exactly once per transition.
- Out-of-order runtime events are serialized before DAP emission.

### Reliability and Testing Requirements

Add Epic 10 test coverage domains:

- tests/contract/debug-adapter/
  - dap-session-contract.test.ts
  - breakpoint-sync-contract.test.ts
  - pause-ordering-contract.test.ts
- tests/integration/debugger-flow/
  - bootstrap-teardown.integration.test.ts
  - breakpoint-hit-and-step.integration.test.ts
  - dual-client-coexistence.integration.test.ts

Required deterministic scenarios:

- adapter startup failure diagnostics
- breakpoint verify and rebind on cell edits
- stackframe and variable expansion on pause
- continue/stepIn/stepOut/next ordering
- VS Code + DevTools concurrent attach and stepping

### Risks and Mitigations

- Risk: line mapping drift from execution wrappers.
  - Mitigation: centralize mapping in stackframe-mapper and validate with fixture-based line-accuracy tests.
- Risk: duplicate stopped states from burst pause events.
  - Mitigation: pause-event-serializer with sequence guards and dedupe keys.
- Risk: session leaks after repeated debug runs.
  - Mitigation: debug-session-manager deterministic disposal and restart-path integration tests.

### Implementation Readiness for Epic 10

Epic 10 is architecture-ready with explicit ownership, contracts, and test gates. Implementation can proceed story-by-story without revisiting core transport boundaries or coexistence strategy.
