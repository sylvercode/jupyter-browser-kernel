# Requirements Inventory

## Functional Requirements

FR1: A user can configure the connection endpoint used by the extension.
FR2: A user can initiate a connection from VS Code to a live browser execution target.
FR3: The extension can identify and select a valid execution target according to the active profile's matching rules.
FR4: The extension can report current connection state to the user using defined platform states: disconnected, connecting, connected, and error.
FR5: A user can manually reconnect the extension after disconnection or target reload.
FR6: A user can disconnect the active execution session from VS Code.
FR7: The extension can preserve coexistence with active browser developer tools connected to the same target.
FR8: A user can run JavaScript notebook cells against the active browser target from VS Code.
FR9: The extension can execute asynchronous JavaScript cell logic and return resolved outcomes.
FR10: The extension can return successful execution values to notebook output.
FR11: The extension can surface syntax and runtime errors as notebook output with message, stack, and source location when available.
FR12: A user can rerun modified cells repeatedly in the same notebook workflow.
FR13: The extension can support execution isolation per cell while allowing explicit shared-runtime patterns such as a shared global namespace when the user chooses them.
FR14: The extension can normalize success and failure outcomes across supported transports and profiles through a shared result contract while preserving transport-boundary isolation from notebook execution semantics.
FR15: A user can inspect execution results inline in the notebook after each run.
FR16: The extension can capture output generated during cell execution and surface it as notebook output, distinguishable from unrelated browser console activity.
FR18: A developer can verify the notebook execution pipeline and shared result contract against deterministic browser-test fixtures without any profile-specific runtime.
FR19: A user can maintain forward-operation and reversal-operation cells in the same notebook.
FR20: A user can execute reversal cells to restore state after experiments.
FR21: A user can iterate through at least two successive snippet versions in a single notebook session.
FR22: A user can install and use the extension through a manual VS Code workflow without requiring Marketplace distribution.
FR23: The extension can expose intentional script output through extension-owned runtime helpers providing intentional output capture, structured logging, and value inspection. Helper naming and calling conventions are architecture-scoped.
FR39 [Post-MVP Core]: A user can start a VS Code debug session for notebook-cell execution and see breakpoint verification, paused-line highlighting, call stack, variables, and watch evaluation in native VS Code debug surfaces.

## NonFunctional Requirements

NFR1: Notebook execution feedback must render within 2 seconds for synchronous JavaScript cells, measured from run command to output render under normal local conditions.
NFR2: Manual reconnect must report success or failure within 5 seconds when the target browser and page are available.
NFR3: Intentional output behavior, when enabled, must render within 2 seconds after execution completion.
NFR4: Manual reconnect must restore execution capability within 5 seconds after target reload when reachable, validated by one successful cell execution without restarting VS Code.
NFR5: Runtime and syntax failures must always surface as explicit notebook outputs; silent failure is not acceptable.
NFR6: The shared result contract must preserve identical success and failure classification across supported transports for equivalent deterministic fixtures.
NFR7: The platform core must remain adapter-agnostic with zero profile-specific imports or literals in core modules.
NFR8: The extension must coexist with Edge DevTools without forced disconnect behavior.
NFR12: Core execution and result normalization must pass deterministic automated tests for success, syntax, runtime, and serialization-boundary cases.
NFR13: Automated platform tests must include reconnect state transitions and serialization boundaries (circular refs, null or undefined, large payloads).
NFR15: The extension must connect only to explicitly user-configured endpoints.
NFR16: The extension must not persist sensitive runtime secrets from evaluated cells unless explicitly saved by user action.
NFR17: User-facing diagnostics must include actionable root-cause category and next-step guidance while excluding sensitive environment details.
NFR18 [Post-MVP Core]: A VS Code debug session for notebook-cell execution must coexist with browser DevTools attached to the same target without requiring forced detach for either client, measured by deterministic integration tests that verify adapter startup, breakpoint binding, paused-state inspection, stepping, and clean teardown while both clients remain responsive.

## Additional Requirements

- Starter template requirement: initialize as a TypeScript VS Code extension scaffold using Yeoman and generator-code with esbuild bundling, then validate ESM output compatibility early.
- Keep strict architectural separation between platform core and profile layer, with interfaces as the only cross-layer contract.
- Use transport-owned connection state machine and profile-owned readiness or eligibility state machine.
- Enforce normalized execution result discriminated-union contract across success and failure; raw transport errors must not leak past transport boundary.
- Maintain deterministic CDP coexistence behavior with active browser DevTools sessions.
- Preserve transport replaceability behind ITransport interface (CDP in MVP, other transports deferred).
- Use extension-owned canonical runtime envelope and controlled profile hooks for execution.
- Keep JavaScript-only runtime scope for v1.
- Require manual reconnect in MVP; automatic reconnect is explicitly deferred.
- Preserve intentional output identity conventions and stable logging/event naming semantics.
- Enforce security boundaries: user-configured endpoints only, diagnostics redaction, no secret persistence by default.
- Implement layered deterministic test strategy: unit, contract, integration, extension-host, and fixture suites.
- Keep tests outside runtime source tree; maintain dedicated test folders and fixtures.
- Structure project folders by architecture ownership, prevent cross-layer concrete imports.
- Keep profile-specific language and behavior additive, not hardcoded into core modules.

## UX Design Requirements

UX-DR1: Present one authoritative connection status indicator using explicit text states: Disconnected, Connecting, Connected, Error.
UX-DR2: Show connection and readiness state continuously with low visual noise in native VS Code surfaces.
UX-DR3: Render every cell run using a labeled semantic output envelope (success or error), never unlabeled free-form output.
UX-DR4: Ensure success output is inline and structured for immediate inspection.
UX-DR5: Ensure error output is inline and includes error type, message, stack, and source location when available.
UX-DR6: Keep error detail disclosure progressive (stack collapsed by default, expandable on demand).
UX-DR7: Keep run-edit-rerun flow frictionless for rapid micro-iteration.
UX-DR8: Preserve forward-operation and rollback-cell adjacency as a first-class reversible experimentation pattern.
UX-DR9: Keep reconnect as an explicit, repeatable, idempotent recovery action.
UX-DR10: On reconnect or eligibility failure, provide deterministic next-step guidance (endpoint fix, target fix, retry path).
UX-DR11: Distinguish intentional execution output from ambient browser noise in both notebook context and output channel context.
UX-DR12: Prefix intentional output lines with fixed core identity prefix JBK for filtering and searchability.
UX-DR13: Mirror inline feedback into chronological output logs to support multi-step troubleshooting.
UX-DR14: Use severity-consistent messaging (Error, Warning, Info, Success) with state-led first line.
UX-DR15: Keep core language profile-agnostic; move profile-specific guidance to profile-scoped UX artifacts.
UX-DR16: Keep all MVP interactions in native VS Code surfaces (status bar, notebook output, output channel, commands, settings), no custom webview dependency.
UX-DR17: Validate settings input with precise field-level error identification and one concrete corrective action.
UX-DR18: Preserve keyboard-first operation for primary actions (run, reconnect, settings access).
UX-DR19: Avoid color-only communication; all critical state and error messages must have text labels.
UX-DR20: Maintain host theme compatibility using semantic VS Code theming, with no hardcoded MVP palette.
UX-DR21: Preserve readability and scannability in narrow pane layouts using concise labels and truncation-resistant wording.
UX-DR22: Keep diagnostics concise, actionable, and copy-friendly.
UX-DR23: Preserve session-scoped execution history visibility to support revision comparison.
UX-DR24: Ensure journey continuity: each failure branch ends with a clear next action to return users to the write-run-inspect loop.
