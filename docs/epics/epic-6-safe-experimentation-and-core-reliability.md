# Epic 6: Safe Experimentation and Core Reliability

**Goal:** Ensure experimentation workflows remain reversible while the core execution pipeline and normalized result contracts are validated through deterministic tests.

**Dependencies:** Epic 1, Epic 2

**Stories:**

## Story 6.1: Validate Core Pipeline with Deterministic Fixtures

As a platform developer,
I want deterministic fixture tests for execution and normalization behavior,
So that core runtime behavior remains stable and profile-agnostic.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** deterministic browser-test fixtures
**When** the core test suite runs
**Then** success, syntax failure, runtime failure, and serialization-boundary outcomes are asserted through the shared result contract
**And** expected classifications are consistent across equivalent fixtures.

**Given** a regression in normalized contract shape
**When** tests execute
**Then** failing assertions identify the mismatched contract fields
**And** the failure includes expected vs actual classification context.

**Given** profile-independent core validation
**When** CI executes core fixture suites
**Then** no profile-specific runtime imports are required
**And** tests remain runnable in isolation from profile implementations.

**Given** the deterministic fixture suite
**When** a breakpoint-binding fixture runs against a static page
**Then** the kernel-emitted per-cell `//# sourceURL` is observed on the evaluated script
**And** the test asserts the Debugger domain is enabled on the session.

**Traceability Note:** Validates NFR12 (deterministic automated validation) and NFR13 (coverage of reconnect and serialization boundaries).

## Story 6.2: Support Forward and Rollback Cell Patterns

As a user,
I want forward-operation and rollback-operation cells to work in the same session,
So that I can experiment safely and restore state predictably.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a forward-operation cell and paired rollback cell
**When** the forward cell executes
**Then** the expected state change is observable
**And** rollback remains runnable in the same notebook session.

**Given** a completed forward run
**When** the rollback cell executes
**Then** state is restored to the expected baseline
**And** restoration outcome is visible in notebook output.

**Given** rollback execution fails
**When** failure output renders
**Then** the failure is explicit and actionable
**And** next-step guidance is provided for safe recovery.

## Story 6.3: Preserve Multi-Version Iteration in One Session

As a user,
I want to run multiple snippet revisions in one notebook session,
So that I can compare behavior quickly without reconnecting.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** at least two snippet revisions run in sequence
**When** both runs complete
**Then** outcomes are preserved for side-by-side comparison in session history
**And** each run remains attributable to execution order and revision context.

**Given** iterative edits and reruns
**When** execution is repeated under normal reachable-session conditions
**Then** reruns remain available without reconnect overhead
**And** the run-edit-rerun loop remains uninterrupted.

**Given** revision outcomes diverge
**When** the user inspects output history
**Then** differences are traceable to specific runs
**And** no prior revision outcomes are overwritten by later runs.
